# Dependency Management Rule
ALWAYS use the latest stable versions of dependencies.
Before implementing any new feature or adding a package:
1. CHECK the latest version on the official website (npm, GitHub releases, etc.).
2. VERIFY that the version specified in `package.json` matches the latest stable release.
3. If there is a mismatch, update the dependency to the latest version, unless there is a documented reason not to (e.g., breaking changes, known bugs).
4. CONFIRM compatibility with the rest of the stack.
